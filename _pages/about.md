#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi, I'm a researcher at GESIS focusing on scholarly document processing and knowledge graph utilisation with an aim to improve detection of LLM use in science, in particular egregious use. I have academic interests in scientometrics, creativity in science, author name disambiguation, reproducible science, web data capture and news verification.

I have worked within the German Competence Network for Bibliometrics since 2023 and am currently working in the [Open Bibliometrics](https://www.open-bibliometrics.de) project from 2026 to 2028. As part of this work I created the [Open Research Converter](orc-demo.gesis.org), which can be used to quickly identify OpenAlex IDs from DOIs in bulk.

In my spare time I enjoy listening to, composing and performing music, throwing together projects in electronics and programming, astronomy and computer games such as Terra Invicta and EU5.
